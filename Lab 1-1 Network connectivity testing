Summary:
In this lab I run several console commands to check the configuration and connectivity of my windows 10 VM.

Useful commands:
1. Ping: allows you to check the response trime of certain IPs or devices
2. IpConfig: allows you to veiw you Ip configuration
3. tracert: allows you to veiw the Ips which your command went through to reach its destination.
4. nslookup: used to lookup domain names and IPs of a DNS

Problems and setbacks:
1. step 12 asks to ping the IPs of those next to you, I had to do this excercise out of class and was not able to do this.
